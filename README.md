# MA5851
Capstone Assignment - Tripadvisor Analysis
The files in this repository are those that make up the fianl assessment for JCU's MA5851 Data Science Master Class 1.

The files include a csv file listing 14 Cairns Hotel/Resorts and key information to be used in conjuction with a webcrawler (Jupyter Notebook)

The second Notebook file is a NLP and DL processor which processes the data scraped and then predicts the reviews rating using a Keras Sequential model.

I trust you will have as much fun with this as I did creating it.

Kind regards

Andrew
